"Long-term satellite observations of tropospheric formaldehyde HCHO are "

"(NMVOCs) are, together with NOx, CO and CH4, among the most important "
"precursors of tropospheric O3. The major HCHO source in the remote "
"atmosphere is CH4 oxidation. Over the continents, the oxidation of higher "
"NMVOCs emitted from vegetation, fires, traffic and industrial sources "
"results in important and localized enhancements of the HCHO levels. The "
"seasonal and inter-annual variations of the formaldehyde distribution are "
"principally related to temperature changes and fire events, but also to "
"changes in anthropogenic activities. Its lifetime being of the order of a "
"few hours, HCHO concentrations in the boundary layer can be directly "
