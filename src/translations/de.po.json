Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) are, together with NOx, CO and CH4, among the most important precursors of tropospheric O3.

Over the continents, the oxidation of higher NMVOCs emitted from vegetation, fires, traffic and industrial sources results in important and localized enhancements of the HCHO levels. The seasonal and inter-annual variations of the formaldehyde distribution are principally related to temperature changes and fire events, but also to changes in anthropogenic activities.

It is produced globally at 300m spatial resolution from OLCI data on the Sentinel 3 mission. The theoretical basis document on OTCI is available [here.](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/349589/OLCI_L2_ATBD_OLCI_Terrestrial_Chlorophyll_Index.pdf)\n\nBlue colors display extremely low OTCI values. They usually signify water, sand or snow. Extremely high values, displayed with white, usually suggest the absence of chlorophyll as well. They generally represent either bare ground, rock or clouds. The chlorophyll values in between range from red (low chlorophyll values) to dark green (high chlorophyll values) and can be used to determine vegetation health.\n\n\n\n[More...](https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-3/otci/)","msgstr":[""]},"# Normalized Difference Salinity Index\n\nThe index visualizes the amount of salt present in soils.
